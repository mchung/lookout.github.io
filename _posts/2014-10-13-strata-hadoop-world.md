To engineer a malware detection engine is a challenging task. Apps need to be acquired, analyzed, and augmented with useful information, so that our team of researchers can understand trends and patterns.  But that's just the beginning. At Lookout, we want to build mobile products that support theft protection and real-time malware prevention for millions of devices.

And this week, we're heading to Strata+Hadoop World Conference to discuss how we do that at Lookout. Our talk is titled **Unboxing Data Startups** (Gilt Groupe, Airbnb, and Lookout) with Emil Ong presenting for Lookout.

Emil Ong is a Principal Software Engineer at Lookout, focusing on data and services infrastructure for the companyâ€™s mobile security offerings. Emil's talk is scheduled at <u>4:15PM on 10/16/2014 in Location 1 E14/1E 15</u>.

The Strata+Hadoop World Conference will be held on October 15th in New York, NY. [Join us to talk about the future of mobile security and big data](http://strataconf.com/stratany2014/public/schedule/detail/36129).
