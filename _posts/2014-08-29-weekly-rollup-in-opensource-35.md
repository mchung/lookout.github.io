Over the past week we've been doing quite a lot of open source work within our
[GitHub organization](https://github.com/lookout). So much so that your editor
is having trouble summarizing all of it. There are over five pages of open
source activity in the Lookout organization's news feed.

This week saw a few patch releases of
[Oraculum](https://github.com/lookout/oraculum) as well as
[Oraculum-muTable](https://github.com/lookout/oraculum-muTable), which provides
draggable interactions to Oraculum's tabular plugin, and
[Oraculum-fastTable](https://github.com/lookout/oraculum-fastTable).

### New repositories

This week we open sourced a gem we've used internally for quite some time
called [sidekiq-cleaner](https://github.com/lookout/sidekiq-cleaner). A brief
introduction from Lookout hacker [Madan](https://github.com/MadanThangavelu):

> *I am happy to introduce the Sidekiq Cleaner gem. This gem allows you to: 1)
> triage (retry/delete) jobs that have failed in sidekiq. 2) It provides a
> breakdown based on failure type and time elapsed.*
> 
> *There are improvements that could be made to triage "retries" too, your pull
> requests are welcome.*


The numbers:

 * 5 issues created
 * 9 pull requests created
 * 3 repositories forked
 * 32 git pushes
 * 1 repositories open sourced
 * 6 comments on pull requests
