With this year's [JRubyConf EU](http://2014.jrubyconf.eu) now over, we can
finally post the slids for [Ian
Smith](https://github.com/ismith) and [R. Tyler
Croy's](https://github.com/rtyler) talk: "Building a Scalable
Messaging Fabric with JRuby and Storm."

We expect the video of the presentation to be posted at a later date, but
for now we just have the slides:

 * [Presentation](/files/building-scalable-messaging-fabric-jruby.pdf)
 * [Presentation *with*
   notes](/files/building-scalable-messaging-fabric-jruby.notes.pdf)


After the conclusion of [Eurucamp](http://2014.eurucamp.org/) we should have
more detailed trip reports, pictures and videos from the entire Ruby-themed weekend in
Berlin.

Stay tuned!
