Last week a member of our Operations team, [Brandon
Burton](https://twitter.com/solarce/), had an article published for
[sysadvent](http://sysadvent.blogspot.com): **[Introduction to
Kafka](http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2014/12/day-4-introduction-to-kafka.html)**.

At a high-level, the Lookout engineering team has been migrating to
[Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org) as an alternative to
[ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/) that better meets the evolving needs of
the Lookout service-oriented architecture.

In the future we'll have more blog posts on our usage of Kafka from the
application/services standpoint, but if you've ever wanted to understand some
core concepts around Kafka, Brandon's
[post](http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2014/12/day-4-introduction-to-kafka.html)
is a good introduction.
